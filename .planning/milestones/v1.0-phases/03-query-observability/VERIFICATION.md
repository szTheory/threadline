# Phase 3 Verification Report

## Goal Achievement

The phase goal — "Operators and application code can query audit history and monitor capture health through a composable Elixir API and telemetry events" — is **functionally achieved**. All five success criteria are satisfied by working, substantive code backed by passing tests. One gap exists: the ROADMAP.md tracking document was not updated to reflect completion, leaving Phase 3 marked as `0/2 Ready` instead of `Complete`.

## Artifact Status

| Artifact | Exists | Substantive | Wired | Status |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| `lib/threadline/query.ex` | Yes | Yes — full filter pipeline, JSONB queries, three public functions | Yes — delegated from `lib/threadline.ex` | PASS |
| `lib/threadline/health.ex` | Yes | Yes — pg_tables + pg_trigger catalog queries, MapSet coverage logic | Yes — called by tests; telemetry delegate wired internally | PASS |
| `lib/threadline/telemetry.ex` | Yes | Yes — three `:telemetry.execute/3` calls with documented measurement maps | Yes — called from `Threadline.record_action/2` and `Threadline.Health.trigger_coverage/1` | PASS |
| `lib/threadline.ex` (delegates) | Yes | Yes — `history/3`, `actor_history/2`, `timeline/0-2` all present | Yes — thin delegates to `Threadline.Query`; `record_action/2` calls telemetry helpers | PASS |
| `priv/repo/migrations/20260103000000_threadline_query_indexes.exs` | Yes | Yes — GIN CONCURRENTLY index on `audit_transactions.actor_ref` | Yes — migration file in standard migration directory | PASS |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| QUERY-01 — `history/3` by schema/id, ordered desc | PASS | `Threadline.Query.history/3` uses `__schema__(:source)`, JSONB containment, `order_by desc`; tested in `query_test.exs` describe "history/3 — QUERY-01" |
| QUERY-02 — `actor_history/2` by ActorRef, ordered desc | PASS | `Threadline.Query.actor_history/2` uses `ActorRef.to_map/1` + JSONB containment; tested in "actor_history/2 — QUERY-02" |
| QUERY-03 — `timeline/1` with `:table`, `:actor_ref`, `:from`, `:to` filters | PASS | Composable private filter pipeline in `Threadline.Query`; all four filter options tested individually in "timeline/1 — QUERY-03" |
| QUERY-04 — explicit `:repo` option on all query functions | PASS | All three functions use `Keyword.fetch!(opts, :repo)`; dedicated "QUERY-04: repo option" describe block |
| QUERY-05 — results are plain Ecto structs | PASS | `history/3` returns `%AuditChange{}`, `actor_history/2` returns `%AuditTransaction{}`, `timeline/1` returns `%AuditChange{}`; asserted in "QUERY-05" describe block |
| HLTH-01 — covered tables tagged `{:covered, table_name}` | PASS | `Threadline.Health.trigger_coverage/1` uses `MapSet` membership check; tested in health_test.exs "HLTH-01" |
| HLTH-02 — uncovered tables tagged `{:uncovered, table_name}` | PASS | Else branch returns `{:uncovered, table}`; tested in health_test.exs "HLTH-02" |
| HLTH-03 — `[:threadline, :transaction, :committed]` fires with `table_count` | PASS | `Telemetry.emit_transaction_committed_proxy/0` emits `%{table_count: 0}`; `transaction_committed/2` accepts caller-provided count; both paths tested in telemetry_test.exs "HLTH-03" |
| HLTH-04 — `[:threadline, :action, :recorded]` fires with `status` | PASS | `Telemetry.emit_action_recorded/1` emits `%{status: status}`; ok and error branches tested in telemetry_test.exs "HLTH-04" |
| HLTH-05 — `[:threadline, :health, :checked]` fires with `covered`/`uncovered` counts | PASS | `Telemetry.emit_health_checked/2` emits `%{covered: covered, uncovered: uncovered}`; tested in health_test.exs "HLTH-05" |

## Anti-patterns Found

None found. A scan of `lib/threadline/query.ex`, `lib/threadline/health.ex`, `lib/threadline/telemetry.ex`, `lib/threadline.ex`, and all three new test files returned zero matches for TODO, FIXME, XXX, HACK, stub, or placeholder markers. No empty function returns or log-only implementations were found.

## Success Criteria Verification

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `Threadline.history(schema_module, id)` returns ordered `AuditChange` records; results are plain Ecto structs | PASS | `lib/threadline.ex:71` delegates to `Threadline.Query.history/3`; returns `[%AuditChange{}]` ordered by `captured_at desc`; confirmed by QUERY-01 and QUERY-05 tests |
| 2 | `Threadline.actor_history(actor_ref)` returns `AuditTransaction` records for a given actor | PASS | `lib/threadline.ex:81` delegates to `Threadline.Query.actor_history/2`; JSONB containment query on `actor_ref` column; confirmed by QUERY-02 and QUERY-05 tests |
| 3 | `Threadline.timeline/1` accepts filter options (`:table`, `:actor_ref`, `:from`, `:to`) and returns filtered result set | PASS | `lib/threadline.ex:95` delegates to `Threadline.Query.timeline/2`; all four filter options implemented in private pipeline; confirmed by QUERY-03 tests |
| 4 | `Threadline.Health.trigger_coverage/0` reports covered and uncovered tables; uncovered tables explicitly flagged as `{:uncovered, table_name}` | PASS | `lib/threadline/health.ex` implements `trigger_coverage/1` (requires `:repo`; ROADMAP wording says `/0` but the implementation correctly requires explicit repo per project convention); uncovered branch returns `{:uncovered, table}`; confirmed by HLTH-01 and HLTH-02 tests |
| 5 | `:telemetry` events fire for transaction commit, action record, and health check; each carries the documented measurement map | PASS | Three events emitted: `[:threadline, :transaction, :committed]` with `%{table_count: n}`, `[:threadline, :action, :recorded]` with `%{status: atom}`, `[:threadline, :health, :checked]` with `%{covered: n, uncovered: n}`; all three confirmed by telemetry_test.exs and health_test.exs |

Score: **5/5**

## Gaps Found

### GAP-1 (Minor): ROADMAP.md not updated to reflect Phase 3 completion

- **File**: `/Users/<user>/projects/threadline/.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- **Location**: Lines 63–64 (plan checkboxes) and line 90 (phase progress row)
- **Current state**: Plan checkboxes show `- [ ] 03-01` and `- [ ] 03-02`; progress table shows `0/2 Ready`
- **Expected state**: Plan checkboxes should be `- [x]`; progress row should read `2/2 | Complete | 2026-04-23`
- **Impact**: Tracking only — no functional code is affected. Phase 4 planning reads this table to establish dependency readiness.
- **Severity**: Low

### GAP-2 (Observation): Success criterion 4 arity mismatch between ROADMAP and implementation

- **File**: `/Users/<user>/projects/threadline/.planning/ROADMAP.md` line 58
- **Current ROADMAP wording**: `Threadline.Health.trigger_coverage/0`
- **Actual implementation**: `Threadline.Health.trigger_coverage/1` (requires `repo:` keyword opt)
- **Assessment**: Not a defect. The project-wide convention is "explicit repo: opt required — no Application.get_env lookup" (documented in 03-01-SUMMARY.md tech-stack patterns). The arity-0 wording in the ROADMAP predates the explicit-repo decision. The implementation is correct; the ROADMAP wording is slightly stale.
- **Impact**: Misleading to future readers of ROADMAP. No functional gap.
- **Severity**: Low

## Fix Plans

### Fix 1: Update ROADMAP.md plan checkboxes and phase progress row

In `/Users/<user>/projects/threadline/.planning/ROADMAP.md`:

1. Change `- [ ] 03-01:` → `- [x] 03-01:`
2. Change `- [ ] 03-02:` → `- [x] 03-02:`
3. Change `| 3. Query & Observability | 0/2 | Ready      | - |` → `| 3. Query & Observability | 2/2 | Complete    | 2026-04-23 |`

### Fix 2 (Optional): Correct arity in ROADMAP success criterion 4

Change `Threadline.Health.trigger_coverage/0` → `Threadline.Health.trigger_coverage/1` in Phase 3 success criterion 4 to match the actual public API.
