# Phase 248 orchestration evidence

This is an execution log, not a product acceptance receipt. Phase 248 remains incomplete until its plan summaries and required verification establish its requirements.

## Reviewed planning

- Three independent focused reviews cover candidate preservation, mount authorization and current advisory/suite evidence. The approved milestone decisions were reused rather than reopened.
- The preservation-only UI contract passed all seven applicable review dimensions; rendered design changes remain in later phases. Its compiler-output consideration probe has explicit acceptance criteria.
- Four serial plans cover ADM-01–04. The independent plan review found one blocker: a classifier that exits zero for `unknown` could not enforce repeat-proof acceptance. The targeted revision captures real run status/log/time, asserts the `pass` token and verifies nine completed clean suite runs. Independent recheck passed.
- Deterministic plan structure and failure-direction checks passed. The verify-path probe returned `not_applicable` for these command forms; that is not a claim that it resolved Mix/Python targets.
- The phase edge probe retains three unclassified requirement rows as explicit assumptions alongside substantive verification. No unclassified item was silently dismissed.

## Isolation and launch

- The active GSD 1.20.0 runtime resolves `orchestrator-worktree` with a usable process descriptor. No worktree opt-out was used.
- The initial base check found no default fork reference. The supported local `worktree.set-baseref` command set `worktree.baseRef: head`; the subsequent base check returned `shouldDegrade: false`.
- GSD created the first plan's executor worktree through `worktree.create`, recorded it in a wave manifest, and verified its initial HEAD exactly matched the reviewed candidate. The worker independently observed matching physical cwd, git root, branch and HEAD before editing.
- Full workflow/role/template/path-safety embeds are supplied on stdin with the CLI's documented prompt-plus-stdin form. GSD rejects a standalone `-` prompt marker as missing prompt data; it did not launch a worker for that rejected descriptor.
- One CLI option-validation failure occurred before model execution: `--sandbox workspace-write` cannot be combined with `--approve-for-me`. The corrected invocation uses automatic approval review, which already selects the workspace sandbox. The failed attempt's record/log were retained, and the clean unchanged worktree was verified before restarting. This was not a product/test retry.
- The active worker's PID, log, actual paths, descriptor and prompt-source provenance are recorded in ephemeral launch metadata and GSD's sibling worker lifecycle record. Public artifacts must use relative worktree identities and source hashes rather than machine-local home paths.

## Verification boundaries

No product tests, dependency updates, workflow changes, hosted CI, issue mutations, version bump, merge or publication have been performed at this point. The first plan owns preservation/provenance only. Advisory and suite findings remain open until their actual remedies and proof run.

PostgreSQL accepts connections on the existing local test endpoint. That is prerequisite availability, not database or test acceptance evidence.
