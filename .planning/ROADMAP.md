## Prior Milestones

<details>
<summary>v1.40 Automated Operator-UI Critique & Forward-Only Iteration Harness (Phases 194-197) - SHIPPED 2026-08-27</summary>

- [x] Phase 194: Deterministic Scorecard-Cube Ledger & Mechanical Capture Foundation (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-03
- [x] Phase 195: Validated Adversarial Critic Runner & Panel (9/9 plans) — completed 2026-08-26
- [x] Phase 196: Forward-Only Net-Positive Gate & First Proven Iteration (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-08-26
- [x] Phase 197: Coverage Growth, Adversarial Closeout & Design-Debt Register (3/5 plans; 03/04 waived — ratified PROOF-02 shortfall) — completed 2026-08-27 (achieved-with-ratified-gap)

`page × persona × lens` scorecard-cube ledger with per-lens monotonic ratchet + evidence-referenced bumps; deterministic mechanical checkers (`mix verify.mechanical`, WCAG dark+light) and Tier A/B/C evidence capture inside `mix ci.all`; golden-set-validated local-only Claude-vision critic panel (7 critics, brand-veto ordering, synthetic-twin oracle, Spearman-ρ trust gate); forward-only net-positive gate with Goodhart/guard-the-guards protections and `$0 --dry-run` path; first human-ratified improvements landed (Evidence density Δ+7, first `ratchet.signoffs` entry); adversarial closeout + design-debt register (owner + reopen-trigger). 28/29 requirements — PROOF-02 closed as a ratified shortfall (paid loop parked on spend/value).

<summary>v1.39 Quality Baseline, Schema Confidence, and CI Efficiency (Phases 189-193) - SHIPPED 2026-07-03</summary>

Repo-evidence quality-risk ranking followed by high-confidence fixes to the three weakest surfaces: configurable PostgreSQL `storage_schema` behavior proven end-to-end for a custom `audit` schema (capture/query/evidence/governance/retention/export/operator, quoted migration identifiers, dual-schema integration test), release/docs version truth reconciled to `0.9.0` behind a drift-guard test with an extended 0.6.x→0.9.x upgrade path, and measured CI/CD efficiency work (caches, min/current compatibility matrix, concurrency, pinned PgBouncer) behind contract guards. Closed with 15/15 requirements traceability and a ranked residual-risk register (owner + reopen-trigger per item). No product/UI scope expansion, no version bump/Hex publish.

<details>
<summary>v1.37 Operator Surface Design-System Stress Test & Component System (Phases 171-180) - SHIPPED 2026-06-20</summary>
